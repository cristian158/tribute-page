     <p><strong>Jeffrey Scott Buckley (November 17, 1966 –
          May 29, 1997)</strong>, raised as Scott Moorhead, was an American singer,
          songwriter and guitarist. After a decade as a session guitarist in
          Los Angeles, Buckley amassed a following in the early 1990s by playing
          cover songs at venues in Manhattan's East Village such as Sin-é, gradually
          focusing more on his own material. After rebuffing much interest from
          record labels and Herb Cohen, the manager of his father, singer
          Tim Buckley, he signed with Columbia, recruited a band, and recorded
          what would be his only studio album, Grace, in 1994.</p>
    <p>Over the following three years, the band toured extensively to promote
      the album, including concerts in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Australia.
      In 1996, they stopped touring and made sporadic attempts to record
      Buckley's second album in New York City with Tom Verlaine as producer.</p>
    <p>In 1997, Buckley moved to Memphis, Tennessee, to resume work on the album,
      to be titled My Sweetheart the Drunk, recording many four-track demos while also playing weekly solo shows at a local venue. On May 29, 1997, while awaiting the arrival of his band from New York, he drowned during a spontaneous evening swim, fully clothed, in the Mississippi River when he was caught in the wake of a passing boat; his body was found on June 4</p>
